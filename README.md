# Image-Resolution-Enhancement-using-GANs
The obejective of this project is to take a low resolution images and tries to generate a high resolution images which looks as realistic as possible. This is achieved by using GANs.

## General info

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have found many applications in Deep Learning. One interesting problem that can be better solved using GANs is to improve the quality of the images. The task objective is upscaling images from low-resolution sizes into high-resolution sizes.Thereby we will use the concept of SRGANs or Super Resolution GANs.
